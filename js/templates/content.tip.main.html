<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html"><b>Welcome to Labcoat!</b></p>
<p>Labcoat by Precog is a friendly tool that allows you to analyze data using a simple, yet powerful query language called Quirrel. This interactive environment makes it so easy to understand data! Experiment with sample data by running preloaded queries or by creating your own queries. You can also learn the Quirrel language with our built-in tutorial and reference guide. Any query you develop can also be executed from inside an application through our REST API.</p>
<p>This is an early preview, so you can’t quite upload your own data but <a href="http://goo.gl/Jtdho" target="_blank">subscribe to our newsletter</a> to learn when you’ll be able to analyze your own data. Now, we'll let you get started!</p>
